## This GitHub Action is defined in a YAML file and consists of one job called "build" that will run on an Ubuntu virtual machine environment whenever there is a push or pull request to the main branch, or when triggered manually using the workflow_dispatch event.


### The "build" job has four steps, each specified with a name and a shell command to execute:

##### The first step uses the actions/checkout action to check out the repository's code.

##### The second step runs a shell script called git-hub-action-script.sh.

##### The third step is a multi-line shell script that performs several actions:

- Prints a message to the console.

- Lists the contents of the current directory using the ls command.

- Checks if Java, Git, and some build tools (Maven, Gradle, Ant) are installed and prints their versions.

##### The fourth step is another multi-line shell script that performs several actions:

- Prints a message to the console.

- Prints the value of the $ANDROID_SDK_ROOT and $SELENIUM_JAR_PATH environment variables.

- Prints the current user using the whoami command.

- Prints disk usage information using the df command.

- Prints a list of available environment variables using the env command.
